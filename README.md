# Stock Variance Prediction Model
This is a simple model build for predicting stock price and produce the variance in Stock price over time.
I'm using a few algorithms based on Linear Regression to conduct this project.
All datasets provided was unauthorized.

# Using
In the last Markdown in StockModel.ipynb file, you can find a function name StockModel with a few instances of how using it to produce the result.
This one can be use to predict the variance of stock after an amount of time for specified Ticker. The result is not totally trustable due to my lack of technique. Further changes might help.
